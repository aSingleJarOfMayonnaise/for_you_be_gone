# for_you_be_gone
A userscript for automatically selecting the Latest tab on a youtube channel's video page to avoid the dreaded For You tab.
The code is a bit of a mess but it works. Sometimes if you switch from home to video too quickly it can get stuck on for you, but I think I fixed it.

All you need to do to use it is to install Tampermonkey, open a new script in it, go to the .js file here, and copy everything from the .js file into the new userscript.
